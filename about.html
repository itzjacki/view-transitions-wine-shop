      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        This website is a demonstration of the
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API"
          >View Transition API</a
        >. The website is built entirely with "dumb" HTML, JS and CSS, with not
        even a static site generator being used. The point was to make something
        that uses absolutely no fancy bells or whistles, other than the View
        Transition API. Because of the decision to do it maximally stupidally,
        there is a lot of repetition going on, and and while I'm glad LLMs are
        pretty good at copying text with minor changes, I do feel like I lost a
        part of my sanity by not using something like Astro here.

        If you want to see the code for this page, it's available
        <a href="https://github.com/itzjacki/view-transitions-wine-shop"
          >here</a
        >
        on GitHub, although be warned that you might discover some dirt if you
        look behind this particular sofa cushion. The demo was inspired by Maxi
        Ferrera's
        <a href="https://live-transitions.pages.dev/">excellent demo</a> of
        Astro's support for View Transitions.

        Endrestad Kielland, you can find me here:
