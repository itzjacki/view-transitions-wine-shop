# view-transitions-wine-shop

Vanilla HTML/JS/CSS demo of view transitions in the form of an imaginary web store for wine

## All vanilla!

This demo is completely free of any libraries or external tools - so all you need to do is open the HTML files after cloning the repo.

## Why the hell is there a 500 line CSS file that only does one thing

Yes - there is an egregious amount of repeated code here - that was the cost of doing this totally build-tool-free ðŸ˜¬. If you want to make something similar, using a static site builder or some sort of light-weight web framework like Astro would be the obvious choice. The reason I did it without was to show that it was possible!
